<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This is the AIPI final individual project.
I choose the topic of health because one of my friends 
felt uncomfortable and made an appointment with a duke doctor. 
He should wait for 5 months. We teased that if this is the case, 
those who have skin diseases will grow mushrooms.

### Start Here

 Below shows what are contained in each folder.

1. Call_Function includes all the function we need to process data and get evaluation result.
2. Model includes a random forest model and a pretrained resnet 18 model. 
   The final layer of the resnet 18 model is replaced and retrained. 
3. Raw_Data contains the raw metadata. Due to the image data is way too large, I cannot upload them to github.
4. Saved_Data contains the tidy metadata.
5. Webelement folder includes some picture for building up the website.
